# ImageSmash

This is a fun application which allows user to generate an image and a quote based on user input search criteria.

## Concept

- The application prompts user to input word or a phrase in search box. Upon hitting a submit button, the request is sent to 2 separate API’s. One API is an  image generator and another is a quote generator. The returned results are displayed together on a card element.

- We were motivated to develop this app for the pure fun.  It has been stressful couple of years with pandemic so a little bit of fun and laughter could help lighten the load.

- As a user I want to be able pull quotes and images and display them together to create off the wall funny messages.

## Process

- We used HTML, CSS, Javascript and external API’s to complete this project Tamara Tina tackled HTML and CSS, Steve and Ian tackled the API and Javascript. 

- This is the first project we have ever done as a group so it took some time to figure out GitHub collaborative process.  How to push, pull and merge. Some of us were seriously sick with COVID which took away considerable amount of time that can be allocated to project. 

- Towards the end of the project we were becoming more comfortable working as a group. We had some lofty ideas for the project, however we did get to complete them all.  We believe we satisfied majority of the requirements, but we did not get a chance to get to all of our “would likes”. However as a group we are committed to continue to develop the project further.
